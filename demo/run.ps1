# Stages one take of the hackathon demo on a fresh copy of the demo repository.
#
# Each take gets its own run folder, D:\dev\acan-run\take-<stamp>, and current.txt names it. A take
# never reuses a folder, so an earlier take's logs are never overwritten, and a stale process from an
# earlier take writes only into that take's folder.
#
# It clones the demo repo into the run folder, copies the live routing and provider key file in, starts
# `acan serve` with the UI and the demo app, mints tokens for the owner and one agent per worker,
# registers the agents, posts the order with its witnesses, and starts one worker slot per agent
# (worker-slot.ps1). It returns once everything is running. Run watch.ps1 next to follow the take.
#
# The owner token is never printed. It is in the run folder, in .acan\tokens.json and in
# logs\ui-url.txt, which holds the UI URL with the token in its fragment.
