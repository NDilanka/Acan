# acan-core design

`acan-core` is Acan's world model. It holds the rules for orders, readbacks, claims, declarations, clashes, gates and landing. The `acan` server and the browser renderer both use it. It does no I/O, reads no clock, and builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

The tests in `tests/` pin the rules below: one file per domain, plus a determinism test that replays a full scripted loop through a replica.

## The model

Each world has one append-only event log. The **origin** is the only process that appends to it. Everyone else (the browser, a desktop joined to a team origin, the hosted replay) keeps a **replica** that folds the same events with the same code.

- A solo desktop runs the origin in its own process.
- A team origin is the same `acan` binary on a shared host.
- A joined desktop sends `HumanCmd` over HTTP and receives `Stamped` events over WebSocket. It does not act while its origin is unreachable.

The server stores each `Stamped` event as JSON and streams the same JSON. A client resumes from `Replica::next_seq`.

Model calls, witness runs and merges are **jobs**. `World::jobs` derives them from state, so a crashed server restarts them by asking again. The server runs each job and reports the result as a `SystemCmd`. A `Barrier` job is a timer: it reports `Tick` once its deadline passes. A result for a job that is no longer derived is rejected.

A `Review` job covers every readback of the order, on an open or claimed task, that lacks a verdict at the current revision. A readback on a claimed task is a standby: once matched, its agent can claim the moment the lease ends. A review result is accepted only while the job is derived and no question is open, and only for readbacks still in the job, each named once. Any part of the job is accepted, because the job grows while a review runs. A late retry therefore cannot rewrite the verdict a live claim stands on.

Clash detection is the pure function `detect`. The origin runs it inside `execute` and records the blocking results as `ClashFound` and `ClashDissolved` events. Replicas never run detection and never need the code index.

## Entry points

| Item | Who calls it | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Origin::open`, `Origin::replay` | server | Start a world, or rebuild it from the stored log. Reports `ReplayError::InvalidEvent` for a damaged log. |
| `Origin::execute(&Ctx, Command)` | server | Decide a command. Returns the stamped events to persist and broadcast, or a `Rejection`. A rejected command changes nothing. |
| `Replica::from_log`, `Replica::ingest` | browser, joined desktop | Fold a fetched log, then apply streamed events. Reports `ReplayError::SeqGap` when events were missed, and `ReplayError::InvalidEvent` for a damaged or forged event. |
| `World` read methods | everyone | `order`, `tasks_of`, `clashes_for`, `phase`, `barrier`, `land_queue`, `jobs`, `settle_right`, `usage`. |
| `detect(&[&Declaration], &CodeIndex)` | origin, tests | Pure overlap classification. |
| `Command`, `HumanCmd`, `AgentCmd`, `SystemCmd` | server, MCP adapter | The write vocabulary. `HumanCmd` is the HTTP body; `AgentCmd` is the MCP tool arguments. |

```rust
use acan_core::{AgentCmd, Command, Ctx, Origin, Rejection, Stamped, Timestamp};

// Server write path: one lock around the origin, persist before acknowledging.
fn claim(
    origin: &mut Origin,
    index: &acan_core::CodeIndex,
    now: Timestamp,
    agent: acan_core::AgentId,
    task: acan_core::TaskId,
) -> Result<Vec<Stamped>, Rejection> {
    let ctx = Ctx { now, index };
    let events = origin.execute(&ctx, Command::Agent { agent, cmd: AgentCmd::Claim { task } })?;
    // store.append(&events)?; hub.broadcast(&events);
    Ok(events)
}

// Browser or joined desktop: follow the stream.
fn follow(replica: &mut acan_core::Replica, streamed: &[Stamped]) -> Result<(), acan_core::ReplayError> {
    for event in streamed {
        replica.ingest(event)?; // on SeqGap, refetch from replica.next_seq()
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Replay checks every event before applying it. An event that refers to an order, task, readback, question, witness, clash or gate run the log never created, creates one twice, or opens the world a second time is refused with `ReplayError::InvalidEvent`, and nothing from it on is applied. The decide functions rely on these references, so a damaged log can never turn a later command into a panic.

`Command` is not deserializable. The server builds it from an authenticated session, so a request can never choose its own principal, and `SystemCmd` can never arrive over the wire.

## Modules

| Module | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `ids` | Typed ids. Counter ids (`OrderId`, `TaskId`, ...) are minted by the origin. Names (`MemberId`, `FilePath`, `CodeRev`, ...) are validated once at the boundary. `Seq`, `OrderRev` and `Generation` are distinct types. |
| `event` | `Command`, `Event`, `Stamped`, `Rejection`, `ReplayError`. This is the stored and streamed schema. |
| `world` | `World` (the fold), `Origin`, `Replica`, `Ctx`, derived reads, and `execute` dispatch. |
| `order` | Orders, witnesses, tasks, readbacks, questions, and their decisions. |
| `lease` | Leases, fences, claim, renew, release and expiry. |
| `clash` | Declarations, `detect`, clashes, settlement menus, the declare barrier, and the build-clear rule. |
| `gate` | Gate runs, verdicts and the land queue. |
| `member` | Members, agent principals, and `SettleRight`. |
| `index` | `CodeIndex`, the input to detection. |
| `job` | `Job`, the work the server derives and runs. |

Each domain module owns both its decide functions and the state they change. Every module is private; `lib.rs` re-exports the public surface.

## State machines

**Task.** A claim cannot exist without both a lease and the readback it was granted on (`Claim { lease, readback }`).

```text
Open --LeaseGranted--> Claimed{Declaring}
Claimed --LeaseEnded(any)--> Open
Claimed{Declaring|Declared|Building} --Declared--> Claimed{Declared}
Claimed{Declared} --BuildCleared--> Claimed{Building}        (no blocking clash, no predecessor to land, barrier not holding)
Claimed{Building} --BuildReported--> Claimed{Gating}
Claimed{Building|Gating} --ClashFound--> Claimed{Declared}   (a gating run is abandoned)
Claimed{Gating} --GateClosed(Failed)--> Claimed{Declared}    (then BuildCleared if unblocked)
Claimed{Gating} --GateClosed(Passed)--> Queued        (lease ends as Delivered)
Queued --Landed--> Landed
Queued --LandFailed--> Open
any but Landed --OrderCancelled--> Dropped
```

**Lease.** Every grant bumps the task's generation, which never resets. Every fenced write whose generation is not the live one is rejected with no event.

```text
Open --Claim: registered agent, readback matched at current revision, no open question--> Claimed
Claimed --Renew(fence)--> Claimed, same generation, later expiry
Claimed --Release | expiry | question answered | gate passed | order cancelled--> lease ended
```

A lease does not expire while its task is gating, because the worker is waiting on witnesses it does not run. A failed gate renews the lease from the moment it closes. So does a new clash that abandons the run.

Only `build_clear` grants `Building`. A failed gate returns the task to `Declared`, and `build_clear` clears it in the same batch unless a blocking clash, a settled predecessor, or its order's declare barrier still holds it. A new blocking clash on a gating task abandons its run, so a late witness result is rejected and can neither restore `Building` nor queue the task past the clash.

**Declare barrier.** Each order has one. It keeps the order's declared tasks out of `Building` until their siblings have declared too, so siblings that overlap meet as a clash before either one writes. Clash detection does not change; the barrier only delays `build_clear`.

```text
Unarmed --the order's first Declared, stamped at t--> Armed{deadline = t + DECLARE_BARRIER_MS}
Armed --BuildCleared for any task of the order--> Lifted
Armed --now >= deadline (Tick or any command)--> Lifted   [BarrierExpired]
```

An armed barrier holds while any task of the order is open or claimed in `Declaring`. A task that is declared, building, gating, queued, landed or dropped does not hold it. `World::barrier` returns the deadline and the tasks it waits for, which is what a declared task shows as "waiting for siblings to declare". `DECLARE_BARRIER_MS` is 90 s, next to `LEASE_TTL_MS`. The core reads no clock: the origin checks deadlines against `Ctx::now` before every command, as it does for lease expiry, and `World::jobs` derives a `Barrier` job for each armed barrier. The server's job sleeps until the deadline and sends `Tick`. A single-task order never waits: its only task is declared, so nothing holds. The barrier never re-arms, so a reclaim or a failed gate is not held twice.

Generations, order revisions and counter ids never wrap or saturate. When one is exhausted, the command that needs the next value is rejected before any event is recorded.

**Clash.**

```text
(none) --ClashFound--> Open
Open --SettleClash, member may only propose--> Proposed
Open|Proposed --SettleClash, member may settle--> Settled
Open|Proposed --redetection no longer finds the overlap--> Dissolved
Settled(Serialize|SplitAtContract) --a party loses its declaration, or the overlap is gone--> Dissolved
```

The owner settles any clash. A member settles a choice whose yielding task is held by one of their own agents, and may only propose otherwise.

A blocking clash dissolves when either party stops holding a declaration (its lease ends, it narrows, or its order is cancelled). A settled `Serialize` or `SplitAtContract` clash still holds its waiter, so it dissolves on the same terms, and when redetection no longer finds its overlap. The one exception is a first task that passed its gate and waits in the land queue. It has no declaration left, but its waiter must not build until it lands, so the clash stands until then. A `Contract` clash records which task owns the interface (`Clash::contract`), because its menu offers to split at that interface.

**Order phase** is derived by `World::phase`, not stored. The order stores only `Splitting`, `Split` or `Cancelled`. Everything after the split comes from its tasks, its open question and its clashes, so the phase cannot drift from them.

**Gate verdict** is derived from a run's results. A witness that errors never counts as a pass. A run's witness set is frozen when it starts.

## The code index contract

Detection reads a `CodeIndex` that the server builds from its scanner.

- `rev: CodeRev` is an opaque content revision. Equal revisions must mean equal contents.
- `files` maps each repo-relative `FilePath` to its machine and its symbols.
- Each symbol has a name, a half-open byte range in the file at `rev`, and whether it is exported.
- `belts` lists import edges between machines. `from -> to` means `from` imports `to`.

Declarations name symbols by file and name, not by range, so they survive a rescan. A symbol that does not resolve counts as a whole-file write.

## What the crate does not do

It does not open sockets, touch git, run processes, call models, read the clock, or store anything. The server supplies `now` and the index in `Ctx`, owns the event table, runs jobs, and logs its own outbound traffic.
