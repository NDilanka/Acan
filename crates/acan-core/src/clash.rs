//! Declarations, pure clash detection, and settlement.
//!
//! [`detect`] is a pure function of declarations and a [`CodeIndex`]. The origin calls it
//! inside `execute` and records its blocking results as `ClashFound` and `ClashDissolved`
//! events, so replicas never re-run it and never need the index.
//!
//! ```text
//! (none) --ClashFound--> Open
//! Open --ClashExplained--> Open (explanation attached; settling never waits for it)
//! Open --SettleClash with Propose right--> Proposed
//! Open|Proposed --SettleClash with Settle right--> Settled
//! Open|Proposed --redetection no longer finds the key, or a party has no declaration--> Dissolved
//! Settled(Serialize|SplitAtContract) --the same, unless its first task is queued to land--> Dissolved
