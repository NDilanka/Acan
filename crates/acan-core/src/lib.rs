//! Acan's world model: orders, claims, clashes and gates as one event-sourced fold.
//!
//! One [`Origin`] per world decides commands and appends [`Stamped`] events. Every other
//! holder (the browser, a joined desktop, the hosted replay) keeps a [`Replica`] that folds
//! the same events with the same code. The crate does no I/O and builds for
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
