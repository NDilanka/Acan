//! Receipts, discrepancy episodes, order-wide repair rounds, and contests.
//!
//! ```text
//! ReceiptReady(run): the run is gating and prepared; the receipt's counts match its items, and
//!   it names the confirmed scope, the prepared context and every ruling at the current head
//!     --> ReceiptRecorded, GateClosed, LeaseEnded Delivered | LeaseRenewed
//! failing item obligation_failed | out_of_scope | violates_ruling --> episode open, bounced
//!   by the next round while the order has rounds left, else stopped and the lane stops
//! failing item authorized_but_unspecified | unstable_base | incomparable --> residue
//! failing item error --> stays open: an infrastructure retry never spends a round
//! episode not failing, its item passing with every originally failing obligation passing
//!   --> fixed
//! FileContest(fence) --> contested; ResolveContest (human) --> residue | the prior state
//! ```
//!
//! Rounds are the order's, never an episode's: a round bounces every open episode at once, and
//! the next receipt answers it. An episode's identity comes from the receipt and excludes the
//! probe, commit and worker, so a new probe spelling, commit or worker continues the same
//! episode and its budget. Missing evidence, a contest or a note never makes an episode fixed.
//! A prediction score is a finding only: the gate reads the classes, never the scores.
