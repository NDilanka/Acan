//! Claim leases and fencing.

//! Open --Claim: registered agent, readback matched at current rev, no open question-->
//!     Claimed, generation = last + 1                         [LeaseGranted]
//! Claimed --Renew(fence): generation current, now < expires_at--> Claimed [LeaseRenewed]
//! Claimed --Release(fence)--> Open                           [LeaseEnded Released]
//! Claimed --now >= expires_at (Tick or any command)--> Open  [LeaseEnded Expired]
//! Claimed --AnswerQuestion on the order--> Open              [LeaseEnded Superseded]
//! Claimed{Gating} --gate passed--> Queued                    [LeaseEnded Delivered]
//! Claimed --CancelOrder--> Dropped                           [LeaseEnded Cancelled]
//! Any fenced write whose generation is not current: Rejection::StaleGeneration, no event.
//! ```
//!
//! A claim by the live holder returns no events. A claim against an expired lease emits
//! `LeaseEnded{Expired}` then `LeaseGranted` in one batch, so expiry never waits for a tick.
//!
//! A lease does not expire while its task is gating: the worker is waiting on witnesses it
//! does not control. When the gate fails, or a new clash abandons the run, the lease is
//! renewed from that moment so the worker has a full window to react.
