//! The Acan plant renderer. The scene is 3D meshes on an infinite grid, drawn by wgpu with a
//! perspective orbit camera (or orthographic on request), four-tone paper shading, and one
//! anti-aliased stroke for every contour and crease, found from each mesh's edges. The model
//! shape is the shared contract in `ui-figure-contract-v2`.
