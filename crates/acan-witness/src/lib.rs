//! Runs a witness check against a task's worktree and reports a [`WitnessOutcome`].
//!
//! The server's `RunWitness` job calls [`run`] once per gated witness. A test command runs
//! through the platform shell (pwsh on Windows when present, else cmd; sh elsewhere) with a
//! timeout that kills the whole process tree. An HTTP check waits for the app port to accept
//! connections, sends one request, and compares the status and body against the expectation.
//! A check that cannot run reports [`WitnessOutcome::Error`], which the gate never counts as
//! a pass. Details are short, human-readable, and never echo the environment.
