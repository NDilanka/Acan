//! The writer: the one task that owns the origin and the current scan.
//!
//! HTTP handlers and the job loop send requests over a channel and await a oneshot reply.
//! Dropping a reply never cancels an accepted write: the writer stages the next origin on a
//! clone, persists the batch, and only then swaps the origin in and publishes the new snapshot.
//! Readers use the published snapshot, so a slow database write never blocks a read. When a
//! persist fails the staged origin is discarded and the writer reads the log back: if the log
//! still ends at the committed world it keeps serving, and if it cannot tell what is durable it
//! refuses every later write, because its world may no longer match the log.
