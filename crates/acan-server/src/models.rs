//! The model client the server runs: the providers in a routing file, with the offline replies
//! behind them.
//!
//! A foreman call never falls back. When it fails, its job fails with the provider error, so no
//! offline split or draft stands in for a live one. Other roles keep a labelled offline answer
//! for a call that fails. Review is retired: its calls are refused before any provider is asked.
//! Live and offline calls are metered in one ledger, so the usage panel shows which calls were
//! offline.
