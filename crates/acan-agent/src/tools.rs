//!
//! The path checks bind these tools and nothing else; they are not a sandbox. Code the test
//! command runs is held back only by the container [`Worktree::run_tests`] starts, and when no
//! container runtime answers, the test command does not run at all. The container's limits are
//! read from a [`ContainerPolicy`]; this module only renders that policy as `docker run`
//! arguments. A protected path is mounted from the protected-head snapshot, never from the
//! worktree, so a protected file the task edited is not what the container sees.
