//! View-independent 3D models of the plant's machines.
//!
//! A model is a [`Model`]: one triangle mesh per level of detail, painted lines and dots, and a bounding box.
//! It is in plan units with z up and its base on the ground, so the renderer can orbit it through 360 degrees
//! and shade it with [`tone_for`]. Each item carries a [`Detail`] so the renderer decides what to show at a
//! given zoom. The kit's proportions and palette are the reference (MIT, see `LICENSE-anatomy`).
