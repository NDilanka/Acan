//! Discrepancy episodes, contests, and readback predictions.
//!
//! An episode is one failure the repair loop is working on. Its identity, the [`EpisodeId`], is
//! the hash of its [`EpisodeKey`]: the order, the difference's selector, and the obligation. The
//! key never includes a probe hash, a step id, a commit, a worker or a run, so a new probe
//! spelling, a new commit or a new worker continues the same episode. The repair budget is the
//! order's, not the episode's: see [`crate::RepairRound`].
