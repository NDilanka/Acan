//! Admission: the only way stored records become evidence the gate may weigh.
//!
//! Storage (S01) reads observations by hash and decodes them as plain records. Before any of
//! them reaches normalization, masking, comparison, a predicate or a receipt, it passes through
//! a function here, which checks it against the stored hashes and the run record and returns an
//! admitted type with private fields. Nothing else constructs one.
//!
//! What a reached step leaves behind, by kind. This is the one completeness rule for runs,
//! retained examples ([`crate::RunManifest`]) and twin runs:
//! - `http` and `observe_side_effect` steps: exactly one stored observation each, which may be
//!   [`crate::Completeness::Incomplete`] but is never left out.
//! - `capture` steps: exactly one [`crate::CaptureOutcome`] in [`Run::captures`] (captured or
//!   missing) naming the step and its binding, and no observation. The outcome proves the step
//!   was reached.
//! - `advance_time` steps: no record. A clock step is reached when the run completed or stopped
//!   after it.
//!
//! Records follow the sequence (the fixture recipe's steps, then the probe's) in order. Which
//! steps were reached follows from [`RunOutcome`]:
//! - `completed`: every step. A completed run missing any observation or capture outcome is
//!   refused.
//! - `timed_out` and `setup_failed` with a step: every step before the named one, which must be
//!   in the sequence (in the recipe for `setup_failed`). The named step may hold its record; no
//!   later step holds one.
//! - `setup_failed` without a step, and `isolation_unavailable`: no step. The run has no record.
//! - `crashed`, `cancelled` and `error`, which name no step: a prefix of the sequence. Every
//!   step before the last record holds its own.
//!
//! [`tour`] admits a model-proposed tour over a plant view by the rule in the
//! [`crate::PlantView`] module docs, and binds its captions.
//!
//! [`retained_example`] admits a retained ruling example against its manifest.
