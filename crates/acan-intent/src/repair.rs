//! Repair rounds: the order-wide repair budget and idempotent round results.
//!
//! Rules, binding on the conductor (C01) and the store (I01) that implement them:
//! - An order has at most [`crate::RepairBudget::repair_rounds`] rounds, two in v1. The count is
//!   per order; a new episode, a new commit, a new worker or a retry never adds a round.
//! - A round bounces every episode open at that moment in one batch, and is answered by one
//!   candidate and one full-corpus run. Opening a round is the only increment.
//! - An episode's `bounce_count` counts the rounds that included it, so it never exceeds the
//!   order's rounds.
//! - A round's identity is the [`RoundId`] of its [`RoundKey`], and a result's the [`ResultId`]
//!   of its [`ResultKey`]. Both are durable across restarts. Recording a result whose id the
//!   round already holds is a no-op; recording a different result for a round that has one is
//!   refused. A worker retry that reports the same merged commit and receipt is the same result.
