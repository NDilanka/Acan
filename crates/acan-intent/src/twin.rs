//! The twin console's capped probe endpoint: a human edits one corpus probe and runs it once on
//! fresh base and candidate instances. API01 implements it; the UI's form decodes these shapes.
//!
//! Rules:
//! - Selected app only. The endpoint runs the receipt's order's app, under the protected app
//!   contract, on the receipt's base and tested merged commits. No request names a command, a
//!   host, a port, a commit or an environment variable.
//! - The form is built from the probe's step schema. v1 edits are a repeat count and a JSON body
//!   per HTTP step, nothing else.
//! - Hard caps ([`TWIN_CAPS`]) on steps after expansion, requests, wall time, kept output and
//!   body size. A request over a cap is refused with [`TwinErrorCode::CapExceeded`] before
//!   anything runs; a run that hits one at run time ends as an error outcome, never a pass.
//! - Every run is a fresh instance with a fresh store ([`crate::Isolation::FreshInstance`]).
//! - Running never mutates the corpus, the ledger, a receipt or an episode. Twin runs are not
//!   corpus runs and never reach a receipt.
//! - Saving is a separate human action ([`TwinSaveRequest`]) that adds a probe with
//!   `origin: human` to the protected corpus. An agent token is refused.
