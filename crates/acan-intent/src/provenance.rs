//! Who authored a value: an observation, the core, a human, or a model.
//!
//! Decoded data and admitted authority are different types. Raw storage and wire records
//! ([`crate::Observation`], [`crate::Run`], [`crate::Mask`], [`crate::Receipt`] and the rest)
//! decode freely and carry no authority. Evidence and core results are [`Observed`],
//! [`crate::ObservedRun`] and [`CoreDerived`]: their fields are private, they have no public
//! constructor and no `Deserialize`, and only [`crate::admit`] and this crate's pure functions
//! make them. Gate and evaluator APIs take only those.
//!
//! A model may propose scope drafts, probe inputs, predictions, predicates and tours, and
//! nothing else: [`ModelProposal`] only wraps a [`Proposable`] payload, and that trait is sealed.
//! Model-facing surfaces decode proposal types only.
//!
