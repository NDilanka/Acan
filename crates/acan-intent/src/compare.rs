//! Run-wide normalization, base-only masks, and base-versus-candidate comparison.
//!
//! Every input is admitted ([`ObservedRun`]) and every output is [`CoreDerived`]; a decoded
//! observation, mask or comparison never reaches these functions.
//!
//! [`check_contrast`] comes first: each run must hold the role its contrast gives it, base A and
//! base B must share a commit and lockfile, and the three runs must share a runtime and a runner.
//! A contrast that fails this is refused with an error, never judged.
//!
//! How a comparison decides, in order:
//! - A run that did not complete, a run that recorded a missing capture, an incomplete
//!   observation, or runs whose step sequences differ is [`Outcome::Unknown`]. Nothing is compared
//!   past them.
//! - Each relation of the plan is a constraint on every run, judged on the original values. A
//!   relation that breaks on base A or base B has no valid baseline and is unknown. A relation
//!   that holds on both bases and breaks on the candidate is a difference, at the fields that
//!   break it. A relation that holds on one base and not the other is an unstable base.
//! - Base A and base B must agree on every value outside a mask, and on the type and format of
//!   every captured identity they both read. A disagreement outside a mask is an unstable base,
//!   not a difference.
//! - Candidate against the bases, on canonical values. A value under a mask is not compared, but
//!   its format must match the format of base A or base B, so a masked field keeps its format.
//!   A captured identity keeps its type and alphabet too. Structure, presence and status are
//!   never masked.
//!
//! Canonical values replace a captured identity with `<capture:BINDING>` and a redacted secret
//! with `<redacted:LENGTH:CLASS:DIGEST>`. Literal text escapes `\` and `<`, so application text
//! can never spell a placeholder. A difference shows canonical values, so a session token is
//! never printed.
